I'm a full-time student pursuing a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Concurrently, I work as a developer at the HUN-REN Institute for Computer Science and Control. In my role, I focus on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous racing. Additionally, I am passionate about creating truly autonomous robots that can learn in a manner similar to humans.
